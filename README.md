# BudgetAPP

This program was meant to help user with his/her finances. Program was build using OOP, thanks to which code looks simpler and easier, and in many ways can be upgraded.
Program contains:

- user account register - name, surname, login, password ;
- user login;
- possibility of addition incomes;
- possibility of addition expenses;
- calculating current month's balance;
- calculating last month's balance;
- user can freely insert his/her chosen period of time to calculate balance;
- personally added some features, which will be punished if provided uncorrectly to program - I would rather, that you do not make any mistakes :) ;

As always - be free to check my code out. If you have any advices, or you have found any bugs - be free to text me.
